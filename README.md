# LandBarronGame

This is a made up game that uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

## How to play:

This is a two player game in which the objective is to make the most amount of money.
You make money by taking turns and bidding on pieces of land.
The game ends when both players pass turns in a row.
The game then finds the cheapest path to get from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
It will then buy the land from whoever owns it for 10 times as much as the user bought it for.
For example if player 1 bought a piece of land for $8 then the company will buy the land from you for $80.
The winner is whoever ends up with the most money
